# Course Materials for PM 566

The PM 566 course website is
[here](https://USCbiostats.github.io/PM566). We will be using
this website to share all course material including lecture slides,
labs, and assignments.

Our class meets at 9 AM every Friday.


# For instructors

Repo overview:

 - `data` contains datasets used in lecture slides.
 - `docs` is where the website is built, you shouldn't need to touch this.
 - `assignments` contains homework assignments.
 - `labs` contains weekly labs.
 - `slides` contains weekly lecture slides.
 
 Every year, you'll at least want to update the Home page (`index.qmd`), go over the Schedule page (`schedule.qmd`), and update the [PM566-whoami](https://github.com/USCbiostats/PM566-whoami) repo ahead of Week 2.
