    "section": "Academic Integrity",
    "text": "Academic Integrity\nThe University of Southern California is foremost a learning community committed to fostering successful scholars and researchers dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge and the transmission of ideas. Academic misconduct is in contrast to the university’s mission to educate students through a broad array of first-rank academic, professional, and extracurricular programs and includes any act of dishonesty in the submission of academic work (either in draft or final form).\nThis course will follow the expectations for academic integrity as stated in the USC Student Handbook. All students are expected to submit assignments that are original work and prepared specifically for the course/section in this academic term. You may not submit work written by others or “recycle” work prepared for other courses without obtaining written permission from the instructor(s). Students suspected of engaging in academic misconduct will be reported to the Office of Academic Integrity.\nOther violations of academic misconduct include, but are not limited to, cheating, plagiarism, fabrication (e.g., falsifying data), knowingly assisting others in acts of academic dishonesty, and any act that gains or is intended to gain an unfair academic advantage.\nThe impact of academic dishonesty is far-reaching and is considered a serious offense against the university and could result in outcomes such as failure on the assignment, failure in the course, suspension, or even expulsion from the university.\nFor more information about academic integrity see the student handbook or the Office of Academic Integrity’s website, and university policies on Research and Scholarship Misconduct.\n\nStatement on the use of Artificial Intelligence\nGenerative artificial intelligence (AI) may be used under the direction and rules specified by the course instructor in specific circumstances as outlined in the syllabus. The student is responsible for the quality and content of all written assignments. Unless otherwise indicated by the course instructor, generative AI may be used to create an initial literature review, document outline and/or to organize material toward a first draft of a class paper, proofreading, or grammatical accuracy; however the final content of the written document and critical thinking of the ideas presented in the document must represent the student’s individual work and ideas learned through course content and/or research conducted from sources outside of the generative AI system. The student must include an annotation on all materials submitted that explicitly documents how AI was used to generate the document and properly reference both the sources and the AI tools such as ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023). The student must review the information in the document and edit for accuracy, completeness, proper grammar, and demonstrate that the wording accurately reflects the student’s understanding and purpose in writing the text. Students should be aware that text generated solely from AI generators may include factual errors, bias, and may contain incomplete or inaccurate reference information, in addition to furthering appropriating knowledge produced by historically marginalized scholars without proper crediting. If you have any questions on whether a specific AI tool is allowed for any aspect of your work in this class, please ask your instructor for guidance. Failure to ensure agreement with your instructor on use of AI, prior to doing so, may result in a zero score. (NOTE: instructors have sophisticated tools to determine AI plagiarism.)"

The Office of Student Accessibility Services (OSAS) is responsible for the determination of appropriate accommodations for students who encounter disability-related barriers. Once a student has completed the OSAS process (registration, initial appointment, and submitted documentation) and accommodations are determined to be reasonable and appropriate, a Letter of Accommodation (LOA) will be available to generate for each course. The LOA must be given to each course instructor by the student and followed up with a discussion. This should be done as early in the semester as possible as accommodations are not retroactive. More information can be found at http://osas.usc.edu. You may contact OSAS at (213) 740-0776 or via email at osasfrontdesk@usc.edu."
