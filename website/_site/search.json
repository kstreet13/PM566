    "text": "Academic Integrity\nThe University of Southern California is foremost a learning community committed to fostering successful scholars and researchers dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge and the transmission of ideas. Academic misconduct is in contrast to the university’s mission to educate students through a broad array of first-rank academic, professional, and extracurricular programs and includes any act of dishonesty in the submission of academic work (either in draft or final form).\nThis course will follow the expectations for academic integrity as stated in the USC Student Handbook. All students are expected to submit assignments that are original work and prepared specifically for the course/section in this academic term. You may not submit work written by others or “recycle” work prepared for other courses without obtaining written permission from the instructor(s). Students suspected of engaging in academic misconduct will be reported to the Office of Academic Integrity.\nOther violations of academic misconduct include, but are not limited to, cheating, plagiarism, fabrication (e.g., falsifying data), knowingly assisting others in acts of academic dishonesty, and any act that gains or is intended to gain an unfair academic advantage.\nThe impact of academic dishonesty is far-reaching and is considered a serious offense against the university and could result in outcomes such as failure on the assignment, failure in the course, suspension, or even expulsion from the university.\nFor more information about academic integrity see the student handbook or the Office of Academic Integrity’s website, and university policies on Research and Scholarship Misconduct.\n\nStatement on the use of Artificial Intelligence\nGenerative artificial intelligence (AI) may be used under the direction and rules specified by the course instructor in specific circumstances as outlined in the syllabus. The student is responsible for the quality and content of all written assignments. Unless otherwise indicated by the course instructor, generative AI may be used to create an initial literature review, document outline and/or to organize material toward a first draft of a class paper, proofreading, or grammatical accuracy; however the final content of the written document and critical thinking of the ideas presented in the document must represent the student’s individual work and ideas learned through course content and/or research conducted from sources outside of the generative AI system. The student must include an annotation on all materials submitted that explicitly documents how AI was used to generate the document and properly reference both the sources and the AI tools such as ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023). The student must review the information in the document and edit for accuracy, completeness, proper grammar, and demonstrate that the wording accurately reflects the student’s understanding and purpose in writing the text. Students should be aware that text generated solely from AI generators may include factual errors, bias, and may contain incomplete or inaccurate reference information, in addition to furthering appropriating knowledge produced by historically marginalized scholars without proper crediting. If you have any questions on whether a specific AI tool is allowed for any aspect of your work in this class, please ask your instructor for guidance. Failure to ensure agreement with your instructor on use of AI, prior to doing so, may result in a zero score. (NOTE: instructors have sophisticated tools to determine AI plagiarism.)"

Once a student has completed the OSAS process (registration, initial appointment, and submitted documentation) and accommodations are determined to be reasonable and appropriate, a Letter of Accommodation (LOA) will be available to generate for each course. The LOA must be given to each course instructor by the student and followed up with a discussion. This should be done as early in the semester as possible as accommodations are not retroactive. More information can be found at http://osas.usc.edu. You may contact OSAS at (213) 740-0776 or via email at osasfrontdesk@usc.edu."

You can leave most of the settings on their defaults for now, just give your document a title (like “Lab 1”) and an author (yourself) and click “Create”. RStudio may ask you if you would like to install a package that is required, and if so, click “Install”.\nThis will open the default Quarto document, which already contains some example content. Read through it, then remove this content. Please do not hand in assignments that contain the default content, as I have seen it plenty of times! Set up new sections in your document titled “Question 1” through “Question 5”. This document will serve as the template for your responses to this lab. Under each section title, add an R code chunk via “Insert…”, “Executable Cell”, “R”. Alternatively, you can switch to the “Source” editor (in the top left of the Editor pane) and add an R chunk by typing the following:\n```{r}\n```\nThis will create an R code chunk and any code you add inside of it will be executed when you Render the document.\nSave your Quarto markdown (qmd) file as lab-01.qmd and see what happens when you click “Render”."

Add your responses to your lab report, with relevant code in the associated R code chunk, and free-form text outside of the code chunk.\n\nLet’s take a look at what these datasets are. To start, we can make a frequency table of the dataset variable:\n\ntable(datasaurus_dozen$dataset)\n\n\n      away   bullseye     circle       dino       dots    h_lines high_lines \n       142        142        142        142        142        142        142 \nslant_down   slant_up       star    v_lines wide_lines    x_shape \n       142        142        142        142        142        142 \n\n\nHere, we used the $ operator to access a specific column (variable) of the dataset. Then we used the table function to summarize that variable. table is great for quickly summarizing categorical variables, but it’s not very useful for summarizing continuous variables, where most unique values are only present once. For continuous variables, try the summary function.\nThe original Datasaurus (dino) was created by Alberto Cairo in this great blog post. The other Dozen were generated using simulated annealing and the process is described in the paper Same Stats, Different Graphs: Generating Datasets with Varied Appearance and Identical Statistics through Simulated Annealing by Justin Matejka and George Fitzmaurice. In the paper, the authors simulate a variety of datasets with the same summary statistics as the Datasaurus, but with very different distributions."

    "text": "Question 2\n\nPlot y vs. x for the dino dataset. Then, calculate the correlation coefficient between x and y for just this dataset.\n\nBelow is the code you will need to complete this exercise. Basically, the answer is already given, but you need to include relevant bits in your Quarto document and successfully Render it and view the results.\nWe’re going to start by subsetting our data down to just the dino dataset.\n\ndino_data &lt;- datasaurus_dozen[datasaurus_dozen$dataset == 'dino', ]\n\nThere is a lot going on here, so let’s slow down and unpack it a bit.\nThe first thing to note is the assignment operator: &lt;-. This special symbol is used to create a new object or assign a new value to an existing one. In this case, we’re creating a new object called dino_data.\nThe second important feature is the set of square brackets: []. When these come immediately after the name of an object, they can be used for subsetting that object. In this case, we want to subset (take a smaller piece of) the datasaurus_dozen data.frame. Since this is a two-dimensional object, we can subset it by either rows or columns, or both. The comma (,) separates our row subset from our column subset. In this case, we only want to subset by row and keep all the columns, so there is nothing after the comma.\nIn R (as in Python and many other programming languages), we can check whether or not two values are equal by using the == operator. Here, we again use the $ to access the dataset variable and we check if it is equal to the value 'dino'. If it is, this comparison will return TRUE and we will keep that row. If it isn’t, this comparison will return FALSE and we will not keep that row.\nNext, we need to visualize these data. We will use the ggplot function for this. Its first argument is the data you’re visualizing. Next we define the aesthetic mappings. In other words, the columns of the data that get mapped to certain aesthetic features of the plot, e.g. the x axis will represent the variable called x and the y axis will represent the variable called y. Then, we add another layer to this plot where we define which geometric shapes we want to use to represent each observation in the data. In this case we want these to be points,m hence geom_point.\n\nplot(dino_data$x, dino_data$y)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# ggplot(data = dino_data, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n#   geom_point()\n\nIf this seems like a lot, it is. And you will learn about the philosophy of building data visualizations in layers in detail in the upcoming class. For now, follow along with the code that is provided.\nFor the second part of these exercises, we need to calculate a summary statistic: the correlation coefficient. Correlation coefficient, often referred to as \\(r\\) in statistics, measures the linear association between two variables. You will see that some of the pairs of variables we plot do not have a linear relationship between them. This is exactly why we want to visualize first: visualize to assess the form of the relationship, and calculate \\(r\\) only if relevant. In this case, calculating a correlation coefficient really doesn’t make sense since the relationship between x and y is definitely not linear – it’s dinosaurial!\nBut, for illustrative purposes, let’s calculate correlation coefficient between x and y.\nStart with dino_data and calculate a summary statistic that we will call r as the correlation between x and y.\n\ndino_data %&gt;%\n  summarize(r = cor(x, y))\n# cor(dino_data$x, dino_data$y)"

These will allow you to specify the size (in inches) of any figures generated by the code chunks in your report.\nYou can also use different figure sizes for different figures. If you are in the Visual editor mode, switch to Source mode. Notice that each R chunk starts and ends with three backticks. Click on the gear icon in the top right of a code chunk and select “Use custom figure size” in the pop-up menu. Set the height and width of the figures and hit Apply when done. Then, render your document and see how you like the new sizes. Change and render again and again until you’re happy with all the figure sizes. Note that changing the figure sizes added new options to these chunks: fig.width and fig.height. You can change them by defining different values directly in your Quarto document as well.\nChange the look of your report:\nIf you have time you can explore the different ways you can add styling to your document. Try adding a theme field to the YAML header and see if you can find valid names of different themes.\nHere is a Quarto cheatsheet and a general markdown cheatsheet\n\nThis set of lab exersices have been adopted from Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel’s class Introduction to Data Science."
