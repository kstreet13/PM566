# Due Date

This assignment is due by 11:59pm Pacific Time on Friday, September 26th, 2025.

# Learning Goals
- Download, read, and get familiar with an external dataset. 
- Step through the EDA "checklist" presented in class
- Practice making exploratory plots


# Assignment Description

We will work with air pollution data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The EPA has a national monitoring network of air pollution sites that The primary question you will answer is whether daily concentrations of PM$_{2.5}$ (particulate matter air pollution with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 $\mu$m) have decreased in California over the last 20 years (from 2002 to 2022).

A primer on particulate matter air pollution can be found [here](https://www.epa.gov/pm-pollution/particulate-matter-pm-basics).

Your assignment should be completed in Quarto or R Markdown.

# Steps

1. (30 points) Given the formulated question from the assignment description, you will now
conduct EDA Checklist items 1-5. First, download 2002 and 2022 data for all
sites in California from the [EPA Air Quality Data
website](https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data/download-daily-data), then
read the data into R. For each of the two datasets, check the dimensions,
headers, footers, variable names and variable types. Check the distribution of
the key variable we are analyzing (PM$_{2.5}$). Write up a summary of all of
your findings.

2. (10 points) Combine the two years of data into one data frame. Use the Date variable to
create a new column for year, which will serve as an identifier. Change the
names of the key variables so that they are easier to refer to in your code.

3. (20 points) Create a basic map (or maps) in `leaflet` showing the locations of the
monitoring sites, using different colors for each year. Summarize the spatial
distribution of the sites. How does this distribution change from 2002 to 2022?

4. (10 points) Check for any data issues such as missing or implausible values of PM$_{2.5}$
in the combined dataset. Calculate the proportion of missing/implausible values
for each year and report any temporal patterns you see in these observations.

5. (30 points) Explore the main question of interest at three different levels of spatial
resolution. Create exploratory plots (e.g. boxplots, histograms, line plots,
violin plots) and summary statistics that best suit each level of data. Be sure
to write up explanations of what you observe in these data.

 - Level 1: State. Examine the primary question for the entire state.
 - Level 2: County. Examine the primary question for every county in California.
 - Level 3: City. Restrict the data to sites in Los Angeles county and examine the primary question for every site.

Reminder: after you upload your final rendered document to GitHub, make sure
that it looks right. If you haven't included `embed-resources: true` in the YAML
header, none of your figures will show up!
