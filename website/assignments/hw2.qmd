## Due Date

This assignment is due by 11:59pm Pacific Time on Friday, October 10th, 2024.

For this assignment, we will be analyzing data from USC’s Children’s Health Study.
The learning objectives are to conduct data wrangling and visualize the data with key questions in mind.

## Data Wrangling

You will need to download two datasets from https://github.com/USCbiostats/data-science-data. The [individual](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USCbiostats/data-science-data/master/01_chs/chs_individual.csv)
and [regional](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USCbiostats/data-science-data/master/01_chs/chs_regional.csv)
CHS datasets in `01_chs`.
The individual data includes personal and health characteristics of children in
12 communities across Southern California. The regional data include air quality
measurements at the community level. 
Once downloaded, you can merge these datasets using the location variable. Once
combined, you will need to do the following:

1. After merging the data, make sure you don’t have any duplicates by counting
   the number of rows. Make sure it matches.
   
   In the case of missing values, impute data using the average amongst 
   individuals with the same values for the "male" and "hispanic" variables. 
   For categorical variables, take the mode.
   If you are interested (and feel adventurous)
   in the theme of Data Imputation, take a look at this paper on "Multiple 
   Imputation"
   using the Amelia R package 
   [here](https://gking.harvard.edu/files/gking/files/amelia_jss.pdf).
   
2. Create a new categorical variable named “obesity_level” using the BMI measurement
   (underweight BMI<14; normal BMI 14-22; overweight BMI 22-24; obese BMI>24).
   To make sure the variable is rightly coded, create a summary table that contains
   the minimum BMI, maximum BMI, and the total number of observations per category.
   
3. Create another categorical variable named "smoke_gas_exposure" that summarizes
   "Second Hand Smoke" and "Gas Stove." The variable should have four categories
   in total.
   
4. Create four summary tables showing the average (or proportion, if binary) and
   sd of “Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (ml)” (an asthma indicator) by
   town, sex, obesity level, and "smoke_gas_exposure."
   


## Looking at the Data (EDA)

The primary questions of interest are:
1. What is the association between BMI and FEV (forced expiratory volume)?
2. What is the association between smoke and gas exposure and FEV?
3. What is the association between PM2.5 exposure and FEV?


Follow the EDA checklist from week 3 and the previous assignment. Be sure to focus on the key variables.

## Visualization

Create the following figures and interpret them. Be sure to include easily understandable axes, titles, and legends. 


1. Facet plot showing scatterplots with regression lines of  BMI vs FEV by “townname”.
2. Stacked histograms of FEV by BMI category and FEV by smoke/gas exposure. Use different color schemes than the ggplot default.
3. Barchart of BMI by smoke/gas exposure.
4. Statistical summary graphs of FEV by BMI and FEV by smoke/gas exposure category.
5. A leaflet map showing the concentrations of PM2.5 mass in each of the CHS communities.
6. Choose a visualization to examine whether PM2.5 mass is associated with FEV.



```{r}
require(nycflights13)


flights <- flights
airports <- airports
airlines <- airlines
weather <- weather
planes <- planes


x <- merge(flights, weather, by="time_hour", all.x=TRUE, all.y=FALSE)


# categorical variables for dep_time, sched_dep_time, arr_time, sched_arr_time
# cut into 4 parts of day


# where there any planes that flew for multiple airlines? Describe how you could answer this question and if there are any, tell us how many and which airlines they flew for.


# which variables from the weather dataset seem to have the most impact on departure delays?




```
