## Tools

- [Apple's Developer Tools](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/technotes/tn2339/_index.html) Unix toolchain. Install directly with `xcode-select --install`, or just try to use e.g. `git` from the terminal and have OS X prompt you to install the tools.
- [Homebrew package manager](http://brew.sh). A convenient way to install several of the tools here, including Emacs and Pandoc.
- [R](http://r-project.org). A platform for statistical computing.
- [Python](http://python.org) and [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/). Python is a general-purpose programming language increasingly used in data manipulation and analysis.
- [RStudio](http://rstudio.com). An IDE for R. The most straightforward way to get into using R and RMarkdown.
- [TeX and LaTeX](http://tug.org). A typesetting and document preparation system. You can write files in `.tex` format directly, but it is more useful to just have it available in the background for other tools to use. The [MacTeX Distribution](http://tug.org/mactex) is the one to install for macOS.
- [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org). Converts plain-text documents to and from a wide variety of formats. Can be installed with Homebrew. Be sure to also install `pandoc-citeproc` for processing citations and bibliographies, and `pandoc-crossref` for producing cross-references and labels.
- [Git](http://git-scm.org). Version control system. Installs with Apple's Developer Tools, or get the latest version via Homebrew.
- [GitHub](http://github.com). Host public Git repositories for free. Pay to host private ones. Also a source for publicly available code (e.g. R packages and utilities) written by other people.
- [GNU Make](http://www.gnu.org/software/make). You tell `make` what the steps are to create the pieces of a document or program. As you edit and change the various pieces, it automatically figures out which pieces need to be updated and recompiled, and issues the commands to do that. See Karl Broman's [Minimal Make](http://kbroman.org/minimal_make/) for a short introduction. Make will be installed automatically with Apple's developer tools.
- [lintr](https://github.com/jimhester/lintr) and [flycheck](https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck). Tools that nudge you to write neater code.
- [Zotero](http://zotero.org). A citation manager that incorporates PDF storage, annotation, and other features. Zotero is free to use and can export to BibTeX/BibLaTeX files.
    
## Paid Applications and Services

- [Backblaze](http://backblaze.com). Secure off-site backup.
- [Marked 2](http://marked2app.com). Live HTML previewing of Markdown documents. Mac OS X only.
- [Sublime Text](http://sublimetext.com). Python-based text editor.
- [Mendeley](http://mendeley.com), and [Papers](http://papersapp.com) are additional citation managers that incorporate PDF storage, annotation, and other features. Mendeley has a premium tier. Papers is a paid application after a trial period. I haven't used either of these, so I can't confirm whether or not they export to BibTeX/BibLaTeX files. Papers can supposedly output citation keys in pandoc's format, among several others.
