# What is this course?

This course is a introduction to the world of data science with a focus on application in the health sciences.

--

The course will teach language agnostic skills that are easily transferable, with examples done in R.

--

You can use any language/tool you prefer. But we can only guarantee help if you are using R and RStudio.

---
